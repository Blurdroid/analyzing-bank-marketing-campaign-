# analyzing-bank-marketing-campaign-
In this chapter, we will analyze data from the direct marketing campaign of a
Portuguese banking institution based on phone calls that were performed between
May 2008 and November 2010. We will not only use the techniques presented in
the previous chapters but will introduce new concepts, such as linear and logistic
regression, that are widely used in data analysis and predictive modeling (predictive
modeling being the process of using data patterns to predict future outcomes). These
types of models have several advantages, but two of the most important ones are
their simplicity and interpretability.
